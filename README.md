<h3>ðŸ“Ž About me:</h3>
<p>Graduate of the Faculty of Computer Science. Previously worked in digital-marketing and had a bit of a fascination with web design. At the moment, I have been studying the front-end direction for about 8 months and managed to get some commercial experience freelancing and in a
small agency. I love non-trivial tasks, but I also take standard
assignments responsibly.
 Unfortunately, the current situation in Ukraine affected my previous
job... Therefore, I am looking for a friendly team with a strong
IT- specialists to progress and conquer new heights together! :)
